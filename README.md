# MB_House_Pricing_Regression
Ironhack midterm project

## Overview

My project looks over house sale data in the Seattle, WA area in 2014-15 and 
attempts to understand the data by looking at trends and creating a model to 
predict the prices of houses if they sold in the area.

## Method

In working through this project, I combed through the raw fifa data to extract the columns 
I thought may affect my prediction model and cleaned the data from any null values and outliers.
I used Jupyter Notebook with tools such as heatmap, OneHotEncoder, Normalizer, and other 
\resources from the sklearn library. I also used MySQL, Tableau, and Slides.com to manipulate 
the data, create visualizations, and present my findings to my peers. 

## Conclusion

Ultimately, my Linear Regression model yielded the most successful outcome with an r squared value of 70.66%.
