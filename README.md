# MB_House_Pricing_Regression
Ironhack midterm project

## Overview

My project looks over house sale data in the Seattle, WA area in 2014-15 and 
attempts to understand the data by looking at trends and creating a model to 
predict the prices of houses if they sold in the area.

## Method

In working through this project, I combed through the raw data to extract the columns 
I thought may affect my prediction model and cleaned the data from any null values and outliers.
I used Jupyter Notebook with tools such as heatmap, OneHotEncoder, Normalizer, and other 
resources from the sklearn library. I then used Tableau and Slides.com to manipulate 
the data, create visualizations, and present my findings to my peers. 

## Conclusion

Ultimately, my most accurate Linear Regression model yielded an r squared value of 70.66%. 
This result indicates my model is fairly accurate in predicting what a house in the Seattle area would sell for in this time period.

## Reflection

I would have liked to have analyzed the details of my linear model through statistics other than r-squared 
with more time as well as continue tweaking the combination of variables used in the model. Additionally, 
I could work more with using log and power functions to better organize columns of data though from my 
initial observations, though the data has already been optimized in several different approaches for the analysis
shown within.
